# Birch Park

### What is it?
The park just down the street from Gossip's Cafe. 

### What do you do there?
Get some fresh air with your friends.

## Message Board/Commons
This is where people can hang out and talk with each other.

## No Auth
Similarly to Gossip's Cafe, Birch Park utilizes no auth. The park is open to all.

## Day/Night
The park becomes moonlit at night.

## Future Ideas:
  - Chess Board
  - Maybe a Canvas "open space". There is an old tennis court at my neighborhood park that has been emptied out. Now people do whatever they want in there. I've seen people rollerskating, dancing, doing yoga, playing street hockey, and playing bike polo in there. I love that it is totally an anything-goes space. Would love to create a space that can feel the same way.
  - Plant a Tree
  - "The Park Bench"
